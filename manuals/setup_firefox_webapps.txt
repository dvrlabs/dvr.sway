The native way is to use the custom stylesheet in Firefox: userChrome.css

Firefox does not load userChrome.css by default in Firefox 69 and later. To make the custom stylesheet effective again, open about:config in Firefox and set the preference toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true

    Before this answer was updated, Mike G wrote a follow-up answer earlier.

How it works

The following code block is the content of userChrome.css that will hide the tab bar, navigation bar and scrollbars in Firefox. Ensure to use valid element names and IDs.

/*
 * Do not remove the @namespace line -- it's required for correct functioning
 */
@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"); /* set default namespace to XUL */

/*
 * Hide tab bar, navigation bar and scrollbars
 * !important may be added to force override, but not necessary
 * #content is not necessary to hide scroll bars
 */
#TabsToolbar {visibility: collapse;}
#navigator-toolbox {visibility: collapse;}
browser {margin-right: -14px; margin-bottom: -14px;}

Limitation: No keyboard shortcuts. Tedious to enable or disable on-demand.

    To restore the default interface, rename userChrome.css to other name like userChrome.tmp and restart Firefox to take effect.

    To use side by side with another instance of Firefox with default interface, use a separate profile.

All profiles are stored in the profile folder, which can be located from Firefox using menu bar or toolbar, then navigate to Help > Troubleshooting Information.
How to setup and use

The following are generic steps regardless of system platform.

    Run Profile Manager of Firefox, then create a new profile named 'hidebars' (any name of choice) and close the Profile Manager.

    Run a file manager and open the profile folder that was created in step 1.

    Under the new profile folder, create new files chrome/userChrome.css including the parent folder chrome if does not exist.

    Copy and paste the content of userChrome.css from above into the created file in step 3.

    Finally, save and close the file.

To start using, run an instance of Firefox with the new profile.
